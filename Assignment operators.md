# JavaScript Assignment Operators:pushpin:
 ***Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables***
Operator `=`
Example x = y    
Same As x = y

Operator `+=`
Example  x += y   
Same As x = x + y

Operator `-=`
Example  x -= y   
Same As x = x - y	        	  

Operator `*=`
Example  x *= y   
Same As  x = x * y	     

Operator `/=`
Example  x /= y   
Same As  x = x / y

Operator `%=`
Example  x %= y   
Same As  x = x % y

Operator `**=`
Example  x **= y   
Same As  x = x ** y

## Shift Assignment Operators
Operator `<<=`
Example  x <<= y   
Same As  x = x << y

Operator `>>=`
Example  x >>= y   
Same As  x = x >> y

Operator `>>=`
Example  x >>>= y   
Same As  x = x >>> y

## Bitwise Assignment Operators
Operator `&=`
Example  x &= y
Same As  x = x & y

Operator `^=`
Example  x ^= y
Same As  x = x ^ y

Operator `|=`
Example  x |= y
Same As  x = x | y

## Logical Assignment Operators
Operator `&&=`
Example  x &&= y
Same As  x = x && (x = y)

Operator `||=`
Example  x ||= y
Same As  x = x || (x = y)

Operator `??=`
Example  x ??= y
Same As  x = x ?? (x = y)
